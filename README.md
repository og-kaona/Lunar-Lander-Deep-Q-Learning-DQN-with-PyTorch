# Lunar-Lander-Deep-Q-Learning-DQN-with-PyTorch
A simple Deep Q-Learning project that trains an agent to land a spacecraft safely in the LunarLander environment using PyTorch and Gymnasium. The notebook shows how a DQN works step-by-step with replay memory, epsilon-greedy exploration, and soft target updates.
